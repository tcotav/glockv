## GlocKV


### Requirements

Repo uses [gb](https://getgb.io/), a project based build tool for the golang.


### Notes

Simple web service to take in a "key" and return an url.  No really...  The key is of the form [lat+long+string-id] 

This is dummy golang app that I'm going to use for deployment and CI/CD writeup.


### Dev notes

This'll pretty much change everything I've got done...
